# CASE STUDY - Stavvy

## Overview and Origin

### What is the name of the company?
The name of the company is Stavvy, based out of Boston, MA.  

### When was the company incorporated?
Stavvy was founded and incorporated in 2018.	

### Who are the founders of the company?
Kosta Ligris and Josh Feinblum, who met while studying at MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, MA.

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Both Josh and Kosta were veterans of the mortgage industry and they both agreed that the mortgage closing process was much too difficult.  It involved too much physical paperwork, and physical travel. This “old school” approach had worked for decades, but as pipelines increased and complexity in the mortgage industry increased, it was becoming unsustainable.  It added significant cost per loan and customer expectations had been changing around technology and our increasingly online world.  A digital approach to mortgage closing was needed.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Stavvy has been funded by venture capital.  They raised $40 million in May of 2021 in a Series A round.  This venture capital financing round was the largest in the history of New England Fintech and Prop Tech. 1  


## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The total cost of originating and closing a mortgage loan is high.  And this cost has only increased over the past decade due too financial regulation after the 2009 financial crisis.  In addition to the health and safety advantages and customer convenience, remote online notarization (RON) lowers the cost of a loan transaction.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer would be lenders of any size that wanted to lower their cost per loan and increase their customer service scores.  Though I think their target market is likely comprised of smaller lenders who are willing to experiment with their process.  The mortgage lending market is still dominated by large players, but the market share of smaller banks and non-banks is increasing.   

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Stavvy’s primary advantage is going to be their user-friendly software.  This is their primary unique value proposition.  They also have a solid onboarding process and good support team to help their new clients bridge the technology gap.  See the citation for a link to their product demo.  

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
Upon review of the product demo, it looks like they are using web-based software.  My guess is that they are using a combination of HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the slick UI.  I would also make a guess that they are using some sort of databased software on the backend such as SQL.


## Landscape

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Stavvy is in the mortgage lending space.  In my opinion, mortgage lending is one of the ripest areas for innovation when it comes to financial technology.  

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
The mortgage industry has been historically slow to adopt financial technology.  The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the customer demand and adoption of virtual closings (RON - Remote Online Notarization).  And over the past decade, there has been a ceaseless demand from the customer to modernize and streamline the mortgage purchase and refinance process.  Here are some of the trends that have developed over the past 5 – 10 years:
* Online housing databases such as the Zillow and Redfin, allowing customers to virtually shop for homes and get much more information than they previously had.

* Digital loan applications and the ability to upload documentation into an online portal. Surprisingly, this has only reached mass adoption in the past 5 or so years.

* Virtual closings (RON - Remote Online Notarization) have only begun to become normal since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stavvy hosts a podcast called Finside Chats and they recently had an episode called “Overcoming Obstacles to Technology Adoption in Lending.”  They had a guest named Jim Deitch, Founder of Teraverde Management Advisors.  In this episode, Jim states that "finally, after 25 years, we are in the final stages of end-to-end digitization of the mortgage process, but more work still needs to be done."  He cited the virtual mortgage closing process as key to this end-to-end digitization.  

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
I believe their primary competitor is DocuSign.  There are some other smaller players in the space such as Notarize and NotaryCam.  DocuSign is quickly becoming the dominant player and Stavvy will need to position themselves well in order to gain market share.


## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Stavvy is a very young company but has been quite successful so far in terms of growth and accolades.  They are laser focus on the closing process is giving them an advantage against DocuSign, which has a broader product offering.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
This type of information is not public, but I would speculate that the primary metrics are customer adoption and customer retention.  The biggest challenge for this type of FinTech offering is that a potential customer would see the benefit but would be unwilling to adopt or unlikely to continue use due to the difficulty of integrating the technology.  Smaller banks and non-bank lenders often time do not have the luxury of large technology budgets or time to experiment with new technology.

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Stavvy has won numerous awards since their inception including the Forbes America’s Best Startup Employers and HousingWire Tech 100 Mortgage.  


## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest that the virtual closing software be simply the wedge that creates space for a type of ongoing consultancy with their clients.  

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I do not know for sure, but based on my review of the product demo, I’m not sure how much of their software is copyrighted or duplication-proof.  I think the ultimate goal should be to be the experts on not just the software, but on how this software could be integrated with the rest of the clients’ workflow.  As mentioned above, probably the major barrier to adoption of new technology is a question on how it will fit within a company’s current technology stack and whether the client can get technology adoption with their own employees.  This is where the consultancy would step in.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The virtual closing software would be the wedge into a business relationship.  From there, it would be Stavvy’s job to integrate the client’s technologies into a sustainable workflow.  This could involve additional technologies such as metric-tracking and project management software.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
At the end of the day, the mortgage industry is still very human being-centric.  It would be a combination of Stavvy’s unique financial technology offerings and their bigger picture integration vision that would foster sustained business success.
